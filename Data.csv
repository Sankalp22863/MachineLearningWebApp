1,JasRaj sawant,"-Sams(having a rough patch ) out -Arshad khan in , good left arm pace bowler, picked for his hitting ability in mi trials .  
-They can replace thampi if they want to and play a sanjay yadav who is basically a 'krunal' 
-Hard for meredith to come in cuz batting kind of dips after 6

Gives a lot of depth in  batting and polly as sixth bowler is fine . The top 4 in great form just need polly and tim to fire , which i am sure they will hopor its not too lateðŸ¤ž . over and out.",2022-04-03T06:50:56Z,0,IN,0.26041666666666663,0.4233796296296296,0.10243298151726872
2,Naman Jain,"I personally say they only have 1 spinner just play Sanjay yadav instead of sams and play Meredith instead of thampi.
And after sometime play unadkat instead of mills or thampi.
Right now other then bumrah none is looking any good.
If they have backed markande so much in auction and they rate so highly why is he not playing instead of Ashwin.
Also why is not tim David bowling he is a allrounder.
They have atleast 7 bowling option as i personally see both Pollard and David to have 1-2 over and other 5 proper bowlers.
Looking how mills is bowling having him as a proper foreign bowlers look unjustified same goes with sams doesn't give much justification to be in the team.
In batting there top 5 look one of the best if Surya start to play.
Looking at these mi really need to use all there bowling option as othe then bumrah none are proper 4 over bowlers.",2022-04-03T06:30:54Z,0,IN,0.14377645502645503,0.2743783068783069,0.08146136486462507
