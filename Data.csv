8,jdudleyh,"With Covid-19 many businesses learned that employees can work form home fairly effectively - while saving money on office operations. When we get out of this pandemic it would be interesting to see companies continue to allow remote work (where possible) while making the office space more fun/interesting/creative/inspiring so employees will want to bother commuting into ""the office"" occasionally.

Given the choice of work from home or commute to drab, fluorescent-light-washed, cubicle hell - I pick home 90% of the time.
Given the choice of work from home or commute to something like GooglePlex - I pick GooglePlex at least 50% of the time. (CA traffic pulls the % down a lot)",2020-12-17T23:35:24Z,4,AQ,0.054888888888888876,0.3607777777777778,0.10912263344400228

Until I saw Facebook's, Google's, Microsoft's, and Samsung's (which was almost like a city) and I was more captivated at how it ""take care of its employees"" by making their design asymmetrical, free-flowing, playful, and carefree rather than projecting sleekness and ""rigidness""  which more often than not creates a ""museum"" vibe where you'll feel scared to move that you'll stumble and break something and doesn't really help whatsover to boost creativity and productivity for its employees.

404,Peter Niedzwiedz,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am a person from Germany and have had computers for 20 years!  My first computer was a Fujitsu Siemens computer from the German Quelle mail order company!  A Fujitsu Siemens computer and an accessory monitor, an HP printer as well as a keyboard and mouse and the Windows 98 SE operating system with key no.  Original CD-ROM with Microsoft Word 2000, Works 2000 and Driver Utility as well as a recovery CD-ROM to activate the hidden MS-DOS partition!  I had this Fuijtsu Siemens computer for 18 years and if there had been old, used DVD drives I would still be using the computer today, it was the best computer there is!  It only had 64MB of RAM, but everything went and worked fine and the computer was very fast at the time!  Now I have a CSL PC with 4 GB of RAM, which is much slower than the old Fujitsu Siemens computer at the time!  What I don't like and what I don't like are those stupid, predefined partitions on the hard drive that create themselves in their original form after being deleted!  In addition, almost all computers can only be operated with the operating system supplied!  Other operating systems are not allowed at all and cannot be installed!  They often have compatibility problems with slightly older, genuine Microsoft products.  whether these programs could not be integrated into the driver database so that they still work after 20 years!  Most of the time the HP printer does not work either because there is probably a software error!  I have an Internet WebStick with a prepaid SIM card!  And the HP printer has Wi-Fi Direct, as well as Wi-Fi and USB termination!  And yet, when I now print IOS Apple with my smartphone and then want to print with the PC, the computer always brings the message No bidirectional connection between computer and HP printer possible, so that it does not scan and does not display the ink levels.  only on the printer itself, in the printer software, yes!  Now switch the printer off and on again and switch off the printer network on the computer, then the printer software will display the ink level again!  Funny what?  What I found out is that you need to install the HP printer twice, then it will show up twice in the printers folder.  Then when you select the software, a window will pop up for you to choose whether you want to have the USB printer or the WiFi network Would you like a printer without a USB cable?  Windows 10 is actually not a really independent pure profit.  10, but consists of Windows Viesta, Win.  XP, Win.  7, Win.8 and Win.  8.1, and therefore there are compatibility issues with the myriad types of computers and operating systems (there are 7 types of Windows 10) and then with the types of operating systems like upgrades, OEM versions, and recovery versions!  This is an OS jungle!  And Microsoft will automatically send updates for all Windows 10 types to all PCs at the same time, and the PCs will install everything and crash because they are not compatible with all versions like 1607, 1903, 1908!  Kind regards ""X""",2020-12-16T00:49:51Z,1,AQ,0.1791256157635468,0.4107375478927203,0.10755565645418237

Hint: Start by trying to show how YouTube, Android, Chromebooks, I dunno, weirdness like self-driving cars has made them a penny in profit. (Pretty sure YouTube and Android never have, at a minimum. Maybe their branded Chromebooks and phones have?) 

The other issue: What innovations have come out of Google in the past five years? Google has displaced Apple as the go-to in elementary and secondary education in the USA due to Chromebooks being both cheaper and more flexible than IPads and Google Classroom being a really robust app, so there's that.
