13,Person 752154561,This fraud story is shocking to me! As an ex-bank employee in Australia it seems we have significantly better procedures at the bank level for dealing with fraud.

14,Arthur Nagae,"First of all, I'm so happy that the fraud case turned ok! (except for all the stress)
Answering as someone who have worked in a few finacial institutions in my country (therefore with zero knowledge about the canadian system particulars), professional money laundering is extremely complex to catch. Money doesn't have unique ids to track, so laundering implies transfering from multiple accounts over and over (most from identity theft accounts until it reaches a few real accounts), through various methods, thining and scrambling the data until it vanishes among real, legal transactions. 
Also, at least in my country, different institutions don't have access to data from the other institutions. And it requires a warrant for each account to have it's privacy lifted for an investigation, and as expected it's a huge bureacracy + time consuming (and in my opinion it kinda has to be, otherwise it opens the risk of giving too much power to a government institution to persecute political rivals, for example). 
It doesn't mean the financial institutions just lay back and do nothing, there are heavy investments in fraud and money laundering detection. We forget that, but we started using banks for it's security, nowadays it counts for the digital world too. Unfortunately for low amounts the money simply disapears in the system. Just imagine how pissed off would you be if the money you should receive (legally) was frozen for days by a bank because of a false positive for fraud? And if it happens for every transaction?
In Linus case, it's most likely pure luck combined with greed from the thieves, since the value of the transaction probably lifted a red flag as it was unusual for that account to receive that kind of money. In previous jobs I've seen accounts being 'warmed up' with increasingly higher values to bypass these kind of detection models.",2022-04-16T03:12:12Z,3,AQ,0.06422070406445407,0.37709347943722943,0.10962044108850177

What happens when those cloud services go away or your devices become too old to be on the supported list? It is fine if they use cloud services to enhance certain functionality, but requiring those cloud services to function at all is basically built in obsolescence.

I believe that at the place I used to work, if we were the ones who sent the wire, we would have made sure the receiving bank and the FBI were aware of the issue, but from there we'd probably never hear anything back other than the money coming back if it was able to be returned. Whether we'd get involved would probably depend somewhat on the attitude of the person in the role responsible for that decision, but my hope is that most people there would at least want to reach out to the receiving bank, since as a credit union, our goal was to help the members, whether it was our legal responsibility or not.",2022-04-16T05:43:14Z,0,AQ,0.071875,0.25787037037037036,0.0810383032605255

81,Jean-Francois Mezei,"Did your wire transfer include identitity of pool contractor and his bank routing numbers, or just the bank routing number? In the former case, it is the duty of receiving bank to verify identity in  transfer matches identity of recipient.
If the contractor deals with bank B and fraudster setup an account with bank C under the name of pool contractor,  it would have needed to produce company registration paperwork to show they control the company.  At which point the real pool contactor is victim of identity theft and they need to go to bank B (their bank) to complain about someone impersonating them at bank C. 

Such investigations are done at bank level. They will elevate this to appropriate police department (bank fraud dept have direct access to relevant group with each police force, something individuals do not) if necessary.  Each bank has a fraud department and talks to other bank fraud departments. Generally, anything above $5k in fraud should get sent to the fraud department. 
 
However,  bank paper pushers who deal with customers are programmed to dismiss such complaints  until you repeat complain often enough that they realise this is real.  Once elevated to bank fraud department,  the people there have much experience with these schemes.

Where a bank loses money, it has more incentive to investigate. When it doesn't lose money (as with your case), they have less incentive to act, so you need to be more adament about escalating this to fraud investigations. So if unresponsive, you need to speak with bank branch manager and start looking to move your accounts to another bank. 

Bank fraud dept rarely contacts individuals with status reports until case has been closed and solved or if they need more information from you.

102,GameRetro,"Look man, gotta pause the video here and say: You can't be even implying that only crimes above a certain amount $$$ are important. Everyone contributes to the society as is, and you'd just be creating a further divide between rich and poor if the poor felt like their belongings aren't worth the time and effort as much as a rich person's.

Think of it as healthcare. Within a universal healthcare system such as many EU countries have the procedures might cost WAY MORE than what the actual insured person paid in their lifetime - but it's morally right and also covered by the sum total of the system.

So if it's ""worth more to just do the work than the item stolen"" that is just an outlier case. If the majority of crimes fall into that category then it's simply a case of the system needing adjustment for how to justify itself - but not a case of who gets to be more privileged.

And I've not even gotten into the idea that a person that steals your Gameboy might steal 20 more from other people, and so catching that person is still as important.

I get the point you're trying to make, and I'm sure you don't mean it as black or white - but again it's not something that's up for debate - since a system of values only works if those values are upheld without any compromise. Your 90K may very well be worth the same as the $300 of someone else.

The fear, trauma, emotional burden and everything else combined - and yes even TIME spent on working to acquire a less valuable item and how much it meant those people is SUBJECTIVE, and you can't quantify it objectively.

Expand this to data, like how much sensitive info or important files you might have on an otherwise cheap device nowadays and this discussion becomes absurd.

I guess I'll leave it at that but again - shocking that I'd be lead to even think that you MIGHT be saying that your 90K is more worth the police's time than someone else's 1K.

They're BOTH equally important cases. (sorry in advance if I didn't cover you acknowledging this as I said I had to pause and do my own HOT TAKE in the comments). Cheers.",2022-04-16T04:41:46Z,3,AQ,0.13867743764172336,0.4957356386999245,0.12805928527664961

214,computerguy61,"Wow, Linus, Ive heard nothing from you about the treatment of the truckers in Canada, or so many other truly evil people in the world today, but for some reason you seem to have a particular bent against Mr Musk, for most of the points you bought up you were relying on the reporting of others, some who may just have a desire for Elon to fail, some who are shorting his stock, some who are jealous, or even some journalists who just need the clickbait titles to gain readership or lose their jobs. If you were speaking in any way from first hand knowledge then I might accept some of your points. As to his slander against Vernon Unsworth, the trial transcript shows Mr Unsworth started the whole saga by telling Mr Musk to ""stick his submarine where it hurts"", one would imagine if Mr Unsworths intentions were really pure, he would welcome assistance from whoever reached out to assist, instead, Mr Unsworth chose to belittle Mr Musks, swift, tech heavy solution of a miniature submarine to possibly help, Unsworth probably felt his heroic efforts were going to be minimized by the media attention when Mr Musks offer was made public. Mr Musk, like Trump is very quick with his careless comebacks, these have gotten him into trouble on a few occasions, but this episode with Mr Unsworth, I feel was a sharp jab back at someone who was trying to help, as misguided as that help may have been, if Mr Unsworth had replied thank you Elon, we would be grateful for any help you might offer, this would have never come to pass, I think Mr Musks comment about Pedo Guy was probably a joust aimed at a man of 65 with a wife 25 years his junior, and maybe even referring to the large number of pedophiles that travel to some asian countries and somethimes live in those countries for the explicit purpose of satisfying their illegal desires with children, this is well documented.

And he may have done it while napping on the couch. But we have to make some assumptions in laws. So level of crime is based on what a dollar was worth in like 1974. (In the U.S. the threshold for the MOST severe theft is like $5,000. There's like $500, $1000, and $5000 are the tiers of crime). But you can increase the penalty above-the-box.

448,Peter Niedzwiedz,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am a person from Germany and have had computers for 20 years!  My first computer was a Fujitsu Siemens computer from the German Quelle mail order company!  A Fujitsu Siemens computer and an accessory monitor, an HP printer as well as a keyboard and mouse and the Windows 98 SE operating system with key no.  Original CD-ROM with Microsoft Word 2000, Works 2000 and Driver Utility as well as a recovery CD-ROM to activate the hidden MS-DOS partition!  I had this Fuijtsu Siemens computer for 18 years and if there had been old, used DVD drives I would still be using the computer today, it was the best computer there is!  It only had 64MB of RAM, but everything went and worked fine and the computer was very fast at the time!  Now I have a CSL PC with 4 GB of RAM, which is much slower than the old Fujitsu Siemens computer at the time!  What I don't like and what I don't like are those stupid, predefined partitions on the hard drive that create themselves in their original form after being deleted!  In addition, almost all computers can only be operated with the operating system supplied!  Other operating systems are not allowed at all and cannot be installed!  They often have compatibility problems with slightly older, genuine Microsoft products.  whether these programs could not be integrated into the driver database so that they still work after 20 years!  Most of the time the HP printer does not work either because there is probably a software error!  I have an Internet WebStick with a prepaid SIM card!  And the HP printer has Wi-Fi Direct, as well as Wi-Fi and USB termination!  And yet, when I now print IOS Apple with my smartphone and then want to print with the PC, the computer always brings the message No bidirectional connection between computer and HP printer possible, so that it does not scan and does not display the ink levels.  only on the printer itself, in the printer software, yes!  Now switch the printer off and on again and switch off the printer network on the computer, then the printer software will display the ink level again!  Funny what?  What I found out is that you need to install the HP printer twice, then it will show up twice in the printers folder.  Then when you select the software, a window will pop up for you to choose whether you want to have the USB printer or the WiFi network Would you like a printer without a USB cable?  Windows 10 is actually not a really independent pure profit.  10, but consists of Windows Viesta, Win.  XP, Win.  7, Win.8 and Win.  8.1, and therefore there are compatibility issues with the myriad types of computers and operating systems (there are 7 types of Windows 10) and then with the types of operating systems like upgrades, OEM versions, and recovery versions!  This is an OS jungle!  And Microsoft will automatically send updates for all Windows 10 types to all PCs at the same time, and the PCs will install everything and crash because they are not compatible with all versions like 1607, 1903, 1908!  Kind regards ""X""",2020-12-16T00:49:51Z,1,0.1791256157635468,0.4107375478927203,0.10544976749226931

Hint: Start by trying to show how YouTube, Android, Chromebooks, I dunno, weirdness like self-driving cars has made them a penny in profit. (Pretty sure YouTube and Android never have, at a minimum. Maybe their branded Chromebooks and phones have?) 

The other issue: What innovations have come out of Google in the past five years? Google has displaced Apple as the go-to in elementary and secondary education in the USA due to Chromebooks being both cheaper and more flexible than IPads and Google Classroom being a really robust app, so there's that. But other than that?
